<p>
The file {{{response-header-filter.xml}}} contains instructions for the filter to process requests. It basically contains a set of [#mapping mappings] which are internally processed as [http://code.google.com/p/responseheaderfilter/source/browse/trunk/src/java/com/avlesh/web/filter/responseheaderfilter/Rule.java Rules]. If an incoming request is found to be a match with one of the mappings, the corresponding Rules are applied to the response.
</p>
<p>For a sample mapping file, [SampleConfiguration click here]
The file content is processed according to these rules:
<ol>
<li>The file <b>should</b> have response-header-mapper as the root node.</li>
<li>Each node (in the xml) with the name mapping is identified as mapping rule and
gets converted into a Rule.<br/>url is a mandatory attribute in the mapping node; mappings without a url are rejected.
</li>
<li>Subsequent mappings for the same url will <b>OVERRIDE</b> the previous Rule.
<i>Last Rule wins</i>.
</li>
<li>Each mapping can have only <b>one {{{default}}}</b> response-header list.
In cases of multiple such declarations, the <i>Last `<default>` declaration wins</i>.
</li>
<li>Each mapping can have any number of {{{conditional}}} mappings.
All these rules are treated as mutually exclusive.
</li>
<li>Both, default and conditional nodes <b>should</b> have a `<response-headers>`
node. In case of multiple such nodes, <i>Last `<response-headers>` declaration wins</i>.
</li>
<li>Each `<response-headers>` node may contain one or more `<header>` nodes. Each such node has to have two mandatory attributes, {{{key}}} and {{{value}}}.</li>
<li>Both, {{{queryParamName}}} and {{{queryParamValue}}}, are required attributes in a conditional tag. They <b>can't</b> be left blank or undeclared.
</li>
<li>Values inside the {{{queryParamValue}}} attribute are parsed as a {{{Pattern}}}.</li>
</ol>
